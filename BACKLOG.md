# Backlog

Deferred ideas and known minor issues — not urgent, not forgotten.

## Daily health check for USASpending API category support

`get_spending_by_category` in `backend/app/agent.py` hardcodes a list of 14
verified-working categories out of the 18 the API contract documents (4 —
`object_class`, `program_activity`, `recipient_parent_duns`, `tas` — 404 live
despite being in the docs, checked 2026-09-03). The tool's error handling
adapts to the live response regardless, so a stale list only costs an
occasional wasted round-trip, never a wrong answer — this isn't correctness-
critical.

Idea: a scheduled job that re-verifies all 18 categories against the live API
daily, persists the result (a JSON file is probably enough), and the tool
reads that instead of the hardcoded list. Needs a scheduler + a persistence
layer we don't have yet — worth doing if this becomes more than a side
project, not before.

## Tied rerank scores in sanity_check.py

The `NAICS` query in `backend/app/retrieval/sanity_check.py` has two results
tied at the exact same rerank score (4.69). Noticed during hybrid retriever
review, never investigated. Probably harmless, worth a second look sometime.
